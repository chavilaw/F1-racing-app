RACETRACK UI/UX DESIGN PLANNING
===============================

FRONTEND DESIGN FOCUS
=====================

This document focuses on the visual design, user interface, and user experience
for all 7 racetrack interfaces. Each interface serves different users with
different needs and contexts.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES
=================

1. REAL-TIME UPDATES
   - All interfaces must update instantly when race state changes
   - No page refreshes needed
   - Smooth transitions between states

2. CLEAR VISUAL HIERARCHY
   - Most important information is largest and most prominent
   - Secondary information is smaller but still readable
   - Consistent color coding across all interfaces

3. ACCESSIBILITY
   - Large, easy-to-read fonts
   - High contrast colors
   - Touch-friendly buttons (especially for tablets)
   - Clear visual feedback for all actions

4. CONTEXT-AWARE DESIGN
   - Employee interfaces: Professional, functional
   - Public displays: Eye-catching, easy to read from distance
   - Mobile/tablet interfaces: Touch-optimized

NOTES
=====

- Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive layouts

- Test on actual devices (tablets, large displays)
- Consider outdoor visibility for track-side displays
- Ensure all interfaces work without internet (local network only)
